    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Experiment</span>:
        In this experiment,
        you will be given several questions where each question contains a picture of many Youtube thumbnails videos.
        You will be asked to select one of the thumbnail that you think you will likely to click.
        As a Youtube user, you will be familiar with the setup as the picture replicates the Youtube recommendation system.
        You always see this page right after finishing watching a Youtube video.
    </p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Answering Questions</span>:
        You can select the thumbnail by selecting the order number of the thumbnail.
        In selecting the best thumbnail, you should consider the title and the image of each video thumbnail.
        An answer is always required and only one thumbnail can be chosen.
        There are no right or wrong answers here beyond your own intuition.
        You should answer each question as quickly as you can, but without rushing.
        The survey would take around 5 minutes.
