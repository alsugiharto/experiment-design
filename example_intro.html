        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The experiment</span>:
        In this experiment, you will be given several questions in which each question contains a picture of many Youtube thumbnails videos.
        You will be asked to select one of the thumbnail videos that you think you will likely click.
        The setup of the picture tries to replicate the Youtube recommendation system with some simplification.

    <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Answering questions</span>:
        You can select the thumbnail video by selecting the order number of the thumbnail.
        In selecting the best thumbnail, you should consider the title and the image of each video thumbnail.
        An answer is always required and only one thumbnail can be chosen. There are no right or wrong answers here beyond your intuition.
        You should answer each question as quickly as you can but without rushing. The survey would take around 5 minutes.

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example questions</span>:
        The experiment will be started by 3 example questions to help you get familiar with the setup.
